# sharex-quickzoom

![trtx: you can radially blur any image and it'll be funny](./resources/screenshot.png)

The purpose of this project is to simply provide an easy way to apply a blur effect to an image using the ShareX application.
The reasoning for zoom is mostly for personal humor.
The effect may reach into being just zoom for radially, depending on how far I can get this project going.
